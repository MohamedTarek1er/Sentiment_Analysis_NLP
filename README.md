📊 NLP Sentiment Analysis Project
This project was developed as part of a college course on Natural Language Processing (NLP). The objective was to build a Sentiment Analysis system that classifies user reviews as either positive or negative.

🔍 Project Overview
We followed a full machine learning pipeline—from data preprocessing to model deployment—to build an effective sentiment classifier.

🧹 Preprocessing
Tokenization
Stopword Removal
Stemming
Lemmatization

📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyzed the distribution of sentiments in the dataset

Visualized key text features and word frequencies

🛠️ Feature Engineering
Implemented Bag of Words (BoW) and TF-IDF for feature extraction

🤖 Modeling
Trained multiple ML models for sentiment classification

Evaluated models using:
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
Confusion Matrix
ROC Curves and other visual plots

🔧 Optimization
Applied Grid Search for hyperparameter tuning
Used PCA to explore dimensionality reduction with best models

🚀 Deployment
Saved the top-performing model and preprocessing pipeline

Built a system to process and classify new reviews in real-time

✅ Outcome
This project provided hands-on experience in combining NLP, machine learning, and data engineering techniques to solve a real-world problem effectively.
