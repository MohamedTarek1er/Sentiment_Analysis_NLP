# 📊 NLP Sentiment Analysis Project

This project was developed as part of a college course on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.  
The objective was to build a **Sentiment Analysis system** that classifies user reviews as either **positive** or **negative**.  

---

## 🔍 Project Overview
We followed a complete **machine learning pipeline** — from **data preprocessing** to **model deployment** — to build an effective sentiment classifier.  

---

## 🧹 Preprocessing
- Tokenization  
- Stopword Removal  
- Stemming  
- Lemmatization  

---

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed the distribution of sentiments in the dataset  
- Visualized key text features and word frequencies  

---

## 🛠️ Feature Engineering
- Implemented **Bag of Words (BoW)**  
- Implemented **TF-IDF** for feature extraction  

---

## 🤖 Modeling
- Trained multiple ML models for sentiment classification  
- Evaluated models using:  
  - Accuracy  
  - Precision  
  - Recall  
  - Confusion Matrix  
  - ROC Curves and other visual plots  

---

## 🔧 Optimization
- Applied **Grid Search** for hyperparameter tuning  
- Used **PCA** to explore dimensionality reduction with the best models  

---

## 🚀 Deployment
- Saved the top-performing model and preprocessing pipeline  
- Built a **Streamlit-based web app** to process and classify new reviews in real-time  

---

## ✅ Outcome
This project provided **hands-on experience** in combining:  
- NLP techniques  
- Machine Learning models  
- Data engineering practices  

to solve a real-world text classification problem effectively.
